## Writing Hello World programs in as many languages as possible

#### Considerations for Hacktoberfest

According to the official website [https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com](https://hacktoberfest.digitalocean.com) we must include the following:

1. Label all Pull Request with Hacktoberfest
2. Add a CONTRIBUTING.md
3. Establish a Code of Conduct (an example is within CONTRIBUTING.md)

If you want to see a guide on how the Pull Request is done see this [link](https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-create-a-pull-request-on-github).
